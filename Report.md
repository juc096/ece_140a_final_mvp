## Market Opportunity & Business Model Mad-lib

**Don't Forget Yo Baby™** is a **For-profit** organization that serves **B2C** customers who need **assurance that their children are safe and not forgotten in vehicles**. We will generate revenue using a **Marginal-Return** revenue model.

### Total market size

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm), there were 3,791,712 births in the United States in 2018. If every one bought a $50 to $100 product the total market size would hover around $185 to $380 million dollars per year.

### Addressable market size

The [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/04/more-than-a-million-millennials-are-becoming-moms-each-year/) states that more than 1 million Millennials are becomes new parents each year who are a part of the demographic most likely to be comfortable enough with technology to adopt our product. Therefore, the addressable market size is roughly $50 to $76 million dollars per year.

### Barriers to entry

There are [certainly](https://patents.google.com/?q=child+car+alarm&oq=child+car+alarm) existing patents in this area. We will need to defer to a patent lawyer to ensure our product does not violate any existing patents.

## Economics – Predicted Costs & Revenue Streams

### Design, development, and production costs

We believe a team of 2-3 engineers working with 2-3 software developers should be able to design this product in no more than a years time(likely overestimate). If we assume the annual pay for each is $100,000 then we can conclude the design/development costs will run at most $600,000, plus [40%](https://www.sba.gov/blog/how-much-does-employee-cost-you) for payroll taxes, benefits, etc bringing the total cost to $840,000. Also, we may be able to lower this cost if we can convince an engineering department at a University to lend their labor/knowledge.

[REX Plastics](https://rexplastics.com/plastic-injection-molds/how-much-do-plastic-injection-molds-cost), puts the typical cost of a plastic injection mold around $12,000 which is needed for the case. It is difficult to find a price for PCB assembly without sending out for a specific quote but [Candor](https://www.candorind.com/how-much-does-pcb-assembly-cost/) puts the average range between $10 to $50 dollars per. We assume this board to not be overly complicated or large so we will use $15. Final assembly will most likely add another few dollars to the cost of each unit.

### Cost to acquire each customer

We plan to run ads through Facebook/Instagram, and Google services. According to [Blue Corona](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/how-much-facebook-advertising-costs/), the cost of ads through facebook obviously varies. However, they indicate that the average cost per click(CPC), and cost per measure(CPM) are $0.51, $7.84 for E-Commerce, and $0.40, $9.66 for Technology industries. We will use the latter, as it is higher and add a safety factor of 1.5x and assume our cost to acquire each customer is about $15.

### Time to acquire each customer

We imagine our ads will begin hitting each customer shortly after they get flagged as "potential pregnancy" through google ad words or facebook ads. As a result we believe the average time to acquire each customer will be around the length of a pregnancy, i.e. 9 months.

### Team size, and annual employment cost

As discussed in the [Design, development, and production costs](#design-development-and-production-costs) we estimate a team size of 2-3 engineers, 2-3 software developers necessary for the product itself. Also we will need an accountant, and an attorney on retainer. The average salary of an accountant is around [$60,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-diego-accountant-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM758_KO10,20.htm) in San Diego. According to [some guy on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-expected-legal-costs-for-a-startup-at-the-angel-and-Series-A-stages) $15,000 should be a good starting point for legal fees. Therefore, employment costs should hover around $1,000,000 annually (including taxes, benefits, etc..).

### Amount of revenue owed to other companies each time a product is sold

We plan to have no dependencies on other companies that will require payment each time an individual unit is sold. However, we will need to defer to our patent lawyer to determine if any royalties would be owed to any potential patent conflicts.

### Margin on each unit sale

As discussed in the [Design, development, and production costs](#design-development-and-production-costs), we estimate the production cost of each unit to be $15 for the PCB, $1-3 for assembly, and $15 for each case molded via plastic injection. This puts the total cost around $35. If the product is sold for $50 to $100 our margins will range from 70% to 200% per unit.

### Revenue stream origins

The revenue streams will originate from our targeted adds on the internet/social media. The adds will be targeted at those who show a potential of pregnancy. In tandem, and perhaps more importantly, our revenue stream will originate from the innate desire for parents to protect their offspring.
