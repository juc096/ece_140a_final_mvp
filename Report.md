## Market Opportunity & Business Model Mad-lib

**Don't Forget Yo Baby™** is a **For-profit** organization that serves **B2C** customers who need **assurance that their children are safe and not forgotten in vehicles**. We will generate revenue using a **Marginal-Return** revenue model.

### Total market size

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm), there were 3,791,712 births in the United States in 2018. If every one bought a $50 to $100 product the total market size would hover around $185 to $380 million dollars per year.

### Addressable market size

The [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/04/more-than-a-million-millennials-are-becoming-moms-each-year/) states that more than 1 million Millennials are becomes new parents each year who are a part of the demographic most likely to be comfortable enough with technology to adopt our product. Therefore, the addressable market size is roughly $50 to $76 million dollars per year.

### Barriers to entry if any (what stops you from competing... things such as existing patents)

There are [certainly](https://patents.google.com/?q=child+car+alarm&oq=child+car+alarm) existing patents in this area. We will need to defer to a patent lawyer to ensure our product does not violate any existing patents.

## Economics – Predicted Costs & Revenue Streams

### Design, development, and production costs

We believe a team of 2-3 engineers working with 2-3 software developers should be able to design this product in no more than a years time(likely overestimate). If we assume the annual pay for each is $100,000 then we can conclude the design/development costs will run at most $600,000, plus [40%](https://www.sba.gov/blog/how-much-does-employee-cost-you) for payroll taxes, benefits, etc bringing the total cost to $840,000. Also, we may be able to lower this cost if we can convince an engineering department at a University to lend their labor/knowledge. 

[REX Plastics](https://rexplastics.com/plastic-injection-molds/how-much-do-plastic-injection-molds-cost), puts the typical cost of a plastic injection mold around $12,000 which is needed for the case. It is difficult to find a price for PCB assembly without sending out for a specific quote but [Candor](https://www.candorind.com/how-much-does-pcb-assembly-cost/) puts the average range between $10 to $50 dollars per. We assume this board to not be overly complicated or large so we will use $15. Final assembly will most likely add another few dollars to the cost.

### Cost to acquire each customer

We plan to run ads through Facebook/Instagram, and Google services. According to [Blue Corona](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/how-much-facebook-advertising-costs/), the cost of ads through facebook obviously varies. However, they indicate that the average cost per click(CPC), and cost per measure(CPM) are $0.51, $7.84 for E-Commerce, and $0.40, $9.66 for Technology industries. We will use the latter, as it is higher and add a safety factor of 1.5x and assume our cost to acquire each customer is about $15.

### Time to acquire each customer

We imagine our ads will begin hitting each customer shortly after they get flagged as "potential pregnancy" through google ad words or facebook ads. As a result we believe the average time to acquire each customer will be around the length of a pregnancy, i.e. 9 months.
