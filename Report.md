# MVP Report

## Market Opportunity & Business Model Mad-lib

**Don't Forget Yo Baby™** is a **For-profit** organization that serves **B2C** customers who need **assurance that their children are safe and not forgotten in vehicles**. We will generate revenue using a **Marginal-Return** revenue model.

### Total market size

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm), there were 3,791,712 births in the United States in 2018. If every one bought a $50 to $100 product the total market size would hover around $185 to $380 million dollars per year.

### Addressable market size

The [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/04/more-than-a-million-millennials-are-becoming-moms-each-year/) states that more than 1 million Millennials are becomes new parents each year who are a part of the demographic most likely to be comfortable enough with technology to adopt our product. Therefore, the addressable market size is roughly $50 to $76 million dollars per year.

### Barriers to entry

There are [certainly](https://patents.google.com/?q=child+car+alarm&oq=child+car+alarm) existing patents in this area. We will need to defer to a patent lawyer to ensure our product does not violate any existing patents.

## Personas

1. Michelle is a manager at an auto insurance company in Chicago. She puts a lot of energy into her work. Due to this, most of her free time is spent at home with her family.

2. Michael is a part time stay at home dad and part time soccer dad. He lives an active lifestyle in Sacramento. He spends his days shuttling children to and from school activities.

3. Daniel is a single man with his elderly father to take care of. Considering he has no additional assistance, it’s common for him to leave his father in the car while he shops for groceries or other errands. He is often worried about unexpected health concerns that may arise while he is away.

4. Janice loves her cats and dogs, and would frequently adopt strays from the streets. Her primary concern is that there are times where she has to leave her pets in her car. She leaves the AC on, but she’s worried about the case where her AC might malfunction one day.

The persona for our potential customers follow these four types.
Type 1, the customer with no free time and energy due to work, and is afraid of an accidental mishap. 
Type 2, the customer who has more time that can be dedicated towards their children. 
Type 3, the customer that wants to better take care of their elderly family members, and/or disabled family members with specialty features.
Type 4, the customer that wants to take care of their pets.

## Economics – Predicted Costs & Revenue Streams

### Design, development, and production costs

We believe a team of 2-3 engineers working with 2-3 software developers should be able to design this product in no more than a years time(likely overestimate). If we assume the annual pay for each is $100,000 then we can conclude the design/development costs will run at most $600,000, plus [40%](https://www.sba.gov/blog/how-much-does-employee-cost-you) for payroll taxes, benefits, etc bringing the total cost to $840,000. Also, we may be able to lower this cost if we can convince an engineering department at a University to lend their labor/knowledge.

[REX Plastics](https://rexplastics.com/plastic-injection-molds/how-much-do-plastic-injection-molds-cost), puts the typical cost of a plastic injection mold around $12,000 which is needed for the case. It is difficult to find a price for PCB assembly without sending out for a specific quote but [Candor](https://www.candorind.com/how-much-does-pcb-assembly-cost/) puts the average range between $10 to $50 dollars per. We assume this board to not be overly complicated or large so we will use $15. Final assembly will most likely add another few dollars to the cost of each unit.

### Cost to acquire each customer

We plan to run ads through Facebook/Instagram, and Google services. According to [Blue Corona](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/how-much-facebook-advertising-costs/), the cost of ads through facebook obviously varies. However, they indicate that the average cost per click(CPC), and cost per measure(CPM) are $0.51, $7.84 for E-Commerce, and $0.40, $9.66 for Technology industries. We will use the latter, as it is higher and add a safety factor of 1.5x and assume our cost to acquire each customer is about $15.

### Time to acquire each customer

We imagine our ads will begin hitting each customer shortly after they get flagged as "potential pregnancy" through google ad words or facebook ads. As a result we believe the average time to acquire each customer will be around the length of a pregnancy, i.e. 9 months. 
We believe we will at most hit a 12 month acquisition length as this service is highly useful during throughout the summer seasons, especially in areas with hot weather.

### Team size, and annual employment cost

As discussed in the [Design, development, and production costs](#design-development-and-production-costs) we estimate a team size of 2-3 engineers, 2-3 software developers necessary for the product itself. Also we will need an accountant, and an attorney on retainer. The average salary of an accountant is around [$60,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-diego-accountant-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM758_KO10,20.htm) in San Diego. According to [some guy on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-expected-legal-costs-for-a-startup-at-the-angel-and-Series-A-stages) $15,000 should be a good starting point for legal fees. Therefore, employment costs should hover around $1,000,000 annually (including taxes, benefits, etc..).

### Amount of revenue owed to other companies each time a product is sold

We plan to have no dependencies on other companies that will require payment each time an individual unit is sold. However, we will need to defer to our patent lawyer to determine if any royalties would be owed to any potential patent conflicts.

### Margin on each unit sale

As discussed in the [Design, development, and production costs](#design-development-and-production-costs), we estimate the production cost of each unit to be $15 for the PCB, $1-3 for assembly, and $15 for each case molded via plastic injection. This puts the total cost around $35. If the product is sold for $50 to $100 our margins will range from 70% to 200% per unit.

### Revenue stream origins

The revenue streams will originate from our targeted adds on the internet/social media. The adds will be targeted at those who show a potential of pregnancy. In tandem, and perhaps more importantly, our revenue stream will originate from the innate desire for parents to protect their offspring.

## MVP Hypotheses

We believe that the customers that are busy and tired from their day job, will use the Don't Forget Yo Baby service because it offers a peace of mind, an insurance policy in cases where they forget.

We believe that the customers who have more time available for their children will also use the Don't Forget Yo Baby service as it offers additional protection, especially if these customers are new parents. 

We believe that customers with elderly folk or people with disabilities to take care of will use the service as a means to remind the customer of their specialized health needs that may vary depending on air quality, temperature, etc. 

We believe that customers with pets will use Don't Forget Yo Baby service as they serve as reminders for them to consider their pets safety and well-being. If they forget they left their pets in their car, it'll remind them of that. If they forget to turn on the AC for them, it'll also remind them of that.

## Key Metrics

Key Metrics to use for these data are:
1. Demographic data of our potential users (income, marital status, having-a-pet status, etc)
2. Fatality rate of animals/infants in vehicles.
3. Data by zone (weather, geography, local news); determine the relation between fatality rates, and different areas of America
4. Measurements of internal temperature time of a car. How long it gets to heat that can cause death. Which time of day is most concerning. etc. 
5. Data on cars. Price of gas if car sits idle. Determine how cars with sensors, temperature adjustors, etc, can better aid the Don't Forget Yo Baby service. 
6. Market trend/business data on other baby-proofing technology.

## Features & Related RATs

Some questions to ask:

1. Parents, pet owners, and etc. caretakers are willing to pay for additional security for their loved ones, but at what cost will customers be turned off to buying our service?

2. Are fatality rates high enough to the warrant concern? Is there a customer base large enough to warrant a creation of this product?

We can address question one by analyzing the cost of other reminder apps and technology on the market. We can also create price estimates and survey potential customers about whether or not this price is something they are willing to pay for in order to use the service. This test can also address question 2, as the amount they're willing to pay is also an indicator to how worried they are about accidentally leaving their kids in their cars. 

## Ethics

We do realize that making a product of plastic is hardly ecofriendly, and the fact that our business relies on the fears of our customer base may result in a business model that may be exploitive and unethical. The intention behind the product is that Don't Forget Yo Baby is an answer to the concern parents, pet-owners, and caretakers of the elderly and disabled, might have to face in light of stories of tragic accidents of unattended victims. It's pivotal that a business like this does not fuel the fears with false advertising and fear mongering in order to keep the amount of customers high. The business is for-profit, yes, but profit is not the priority behind a product such as this.
